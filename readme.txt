This example is using a virtual environment create with the following command:
C:\Python3.12\python.exe -m venv env
To activate this virtual environment on Windows, you would use:
env\Scripts\activate

To install the dependencies run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


The solution provided is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using the Gemini API with LangChain. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

1. Problem Overview
The goal is to create a system where the model generates responses based not only on the input prompt but also on additional context retrieved from a file. In this example, the system generates a tweet based on a given topic and uses context from a text document to inform and ground the response.

2. Components of the Solution
Environment Setup (dotenv):

The dotenv library is used to load environment variables, specifically the Google API key required to authenticate and access the Gemini API. This key is stored in an .env file for security.
Language Model Initialization (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI):

The ChatGoogleGenerativeAI class from langchain-google-genai is initialized with the model name gemini-pro and the Google API key. This object represents the language model we will use to generate responses.
Prompt Template:

The PromptTemplate class from LangChain is used to define a structured prompt. This template has placeholders ({topic} and {context}) that will be filled with dynamic content when the model is invoked.
The prompt structure is:

You are a content creator. Given the context below, write me a tweet about {topic}.

Context:
{context}
This instructs the model to consider the additional context before generating a tweet about the given topic.
Chain Creation (LLMChain):

The LLMChain class is used to create a chain of operations that involve processing the input, filling the prompt template, and generating a response using the language model.
The chain is configured with the prompt template and the LLM (language model) object.
File Reading Function (read_content_from_file):

A helper function reads the content of a specified file (document.txt in the data folder).
This function returns the text content of the file, which will be used as the context for the prompt.
Error handling is included to catch any issues that might occur while reading the file, such as a missing file or incorrect path.
Main Execution Logic:

The script defines a topic ("how AI is revolutionizing education") and a file path (data/document.txt) for the context.
The context is read from the file using the read_content_from_file function.
The tweet_chain.run() method is called with both the topic and context. The model uses this context to generate a more informed and relevant tweet based on the given topic.
Output:

The generated tweet is printed to the console. This tweet should reflect not just the given topic but also incorporate information from the context in document.txt.
3. Advantages of this Approach
Grounded Responses: By using content from a file as context, the language model's responses are more accurate and relevant, especially for domain-specific queries.
Flexibility: You can easily change the context by modifying the file content or pointing to a different file, making the solution adaptable to various scenarios.
Simplicity: The solution is straightforward and uses minimal components, making it easy to understand and extend.
4. Further Enhancements
Advanced Retrieval: Instead of reading a single file, you could use a more sophisticated retrieval system, such as a vector database, to find and retrieve the most relevant documents dynamically.
Scalability: For large datasets, you might want to implement a search mechanism that identifies the most relevant pieces of content to include as context, rather than loading an entire document.
User Interface: Adding a simple UI or API endpoint would allow users to interact with the system more easily.

This solution demonstrates how to use LangChain and the Gemini API for a basic RAG setup, providing a solid foundation for building more complex and interactive applications.
